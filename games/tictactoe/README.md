# Tictactoe

This repository contains a basic example of a dApp game, namely a decentralized Tictactoe.

You'll find in [smart-contract](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/tree/main/games/tictactoe/smart-contract)
the smart-contract logic used to implement the game and in the
[html](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/tree/main/games/tictactoe/html) folder the front-end used to
interact with the smart-contract developed using the [massa-web3](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3) library.
